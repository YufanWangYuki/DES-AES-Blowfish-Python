# DES-AES-Blowfish-Python
## Brief Introduction
This part is for the coursewrok for the Security and Authentication course. The main function is to use Python to evaluate the performance of three conventional encryption algorithms, AES, DES and Blowfish.

### generate_file.py
For generating files for using encryption algorithms.

### Encryption.py
For using AES, DES and Blowfish algorithms and evaluate their performance in running time and memory usage based on Python API .
